{/* Other Bundlers */}

Nativewind officially supports Metro bundler, which is the default bundler for React Native. We also provide installation instructions for Next.js (which uses Webpack and Turbopack) as it's a popular choice for React Native Web applications.

To use Nativewind with any bundler, three key conditions must be met:

1. Tailwind CSS is setup with the Nativewind preset
2. React Native is setup and you are using React Native Web >=0.19
3. The JSX runtime is changed to `'automatic'` and `jsxImportSource` set to `'nativewind'`

## Alternative Bundlers

While Nativewind officially supports Metro, there are community-driven solutions for using Nativewind with other bundlers:

### OneJS
[OneJS](https://onestack.dev/) provides a starter template for using Nativewind with Vite. This integration is currently in alpha, and the team welcomes feedback and contributions.

### Re.Pack
[Re.Pack](https://github.com/callstack/repack) by Callstack is a Webpack-based toolkit for building React Native applications. It provides an alternative to Metro bundler and can be configured to work with Nativewind.
